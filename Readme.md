# First time Build (Linux binaries only supported for now):

1. `chmod +x install.sh`

2. `./install.sh` 

The resulting files will be in the bin directory. This is a very long build process. 20 minutes +

This project has been born due to the fact that I was developing on imgui_manual code, and my SSD failed. I lost all my backups, and had to start afresh. To my dismay, I found I had to install all these unneccessary libraries on my Linux machine, just to get back to coding to get the project runnning again. I almost gave up on it, but in the end I decided the best choice was to create a build system that would handle the building independently of my OS, outside of my machine scope, inside a Docker Container called jrpc-linux-buildsystem.

Every resulting build process after the first should only take minutes if not seconds, unless you modified the build container dockerfile.
